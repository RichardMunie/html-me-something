                <h2 class="to_center">The Early Stages</h2>
                <p>It all began with inspiration from a primitive fiddle I had seen in a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=saint%20louis%20violin%20shop&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-b-1&npsic=0&rflfq=1&rlha=0&rllag=38600002,-90292396,4030&tbm=lcl&rldimm=16716875827013104991&ved=0ahUKEwiEr7Xts__ZAhXQ0FMKHR_wCc8QvS4IXjAA&rldoc=1&tbs=lrf:!2m4!1e17!4m2!17m1!1e2!2m1!1e2!2m1!1e3!3sIAE,lf:1,lf_ui:10#rlfi=hd:;si:16716875827013104991;mv:!1m3!1d77912.10219375486!2d-90.31376569999999!3d38.637746!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i122!2i300!4f13.1;tbs:lrf:!2m1!1e2!2m1!1e3!2m4!1e17!4m2!17m1!1e2!3sIAE,lf:1,lf_ui:10">violin shop</a> in Saint Louis, Mo. The violin was rough, primitive and had a face if I remember correctly. A girl I was crushing on went there to buy an upgrade from her first violin. Being fond of taking my fiddle down to the river and wanting her to have a fiddle that she could take as well, without worrying about damaging a pricey instrument, I figured I would just carve out a primitive instrument like the one I saw on the wall at the shop. From there it started with an oak log.</p>
                <img class="tallwide" src="the_log.jpg" />
                <p>The log I had procured from a friend who was in the tree felling business, a nice oak log. Armed with some primitive tools I began to hew away at the log, intent to shape it into a turtle which I happened to know the young lady fancied. It was hot that summer, the mosquitoes were ruthless and unrelenting. I would sometimes take the work into the basement just to avoid thier assault.</p>

                <h2 class = "to_center">Taking Shape</h2>
                <p>still using primitive tools I began the arduous task of hollowing out the inside of the log. This is the point I called the fruit bowl stage for reasons readily apparent. I figured if anything I could have a fruit bowl. By this time the muse for which I toiled to bestow the fruit of this labor had begun seeing a deusche bag but I was undetered. The work had become a meditation for me of sorts and a vision was forming in my head. New elements in the design stirred in my head as I hammered away at the chunck of oak. I had consulted at one point a luthier, looking for a fingerboard. He told me I didn't want to use oak, it was too heavy a wood and would not produce any sound. I also had shown my work to a carver who had sharpened a gouge for me. He said I didn't want to use oak, it would split on me. It had, I glued it. Needless to say, I ignored any expert advice that was given.</p>
                <img class="tallwide" src="fruit_bowl_stage.jpg"/>
                <p>At one point I realized that there is a reason that violins are waisted. That means the go in at the middle of the bodies kind of like the waist of a woman. The purpose of waisting is so that the bow is free to attack the strings at an angle in order to engage a single string. This is about time I started to give the turtle shell details and I now had to bring in the waist even though I had already begun to hollow it out. Had I hollowed it out to much? This is where forethought and designing ahead of execution might have saved me from some worry but I forged on ahead and things began to take shape.</p>

                <h2 class = "to_center">All in the Details</h2>
                <p>Several design elements came to me as I hammered away in a near trance state that hot summer. One such idea was to make the tuning pegs dragonflies in the mouth of the turtle. The tail piece would be a frog. To this end I went to a specialty <a href="https://www.hibdonhardwood.com/">wood supplier</a> in Saint Louis. I got some black african wood and proceded to carve out some of the pieces that would be needed to complete the work. The frog I was quite pleased with and it was fun to carry around, felt good in the hand almost like some voo doo fetish. The dragon flies turned out ok but I am still to this day not satisfied that I cannot produce better.</p>

                <img class="wide" src="feet.jpg"/>
                <p>I had ordered a piece of spruce for the sound board. I figured I would atleast use the appropriate wood for the part that is most crucial to producing sound. I carved sound holes, not quite the usual f holes you see on a violin but something that fit the theme. Turtle feet! And to these I added claws from the wood I got at the special wood shop.</p>

                <img src="more_claws.jpg"/>
                <p>I also got it signed by the girls favorite band. I took it to the show we went to see and while she was not looking I snuck it in to my friend that worded sound at the Paegent and he got it to the members of Trampled by Turtles who signed it. I picked it up the next day, took the <a href="https://www.metrostlouis.org/metrolink/">Metrolink</a>. Slick. Never saw it coming.</p>

                <h2 class = "to_center">The Vision Coming Together</h2>
                <p>My brothers violin teacher was instrumental in bringing the final product to life. He helped with the set up, the peg shaping and boring the peg holes. He advised me on how to get the neck and finger board all set up. Provided strings. A big shout out to Philip Tinge, for his help in realizing the vision.</p>

                <img src="setup.jpg"/>
                <p>Another thing Philip had helped me with was coming up with a chin rest. A fish I decided. And with some materials he supplied it was attached to a lilly pad.</p>

                <a name="case"></a>
                <h2 class = "to_center">The Case</h2>
                <p>Several inspirations lead to the creation of the case, a whole work in and of itself. One was a picture of a lake I had found where the reflection was absolutely serene. I decided to carve it in the inside of a log I had split with a pick axe and a railroad crowbar I found on the road. I proceded to carve the scene in relief and then painted the entire thing, like a boss.</p>
                <img class="narrow" src="case_work.jpg"/>
                <img class="wide" src="case_painted.jpg"/>
                <p>Another was a book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Violin-Hunter-William-Silverman/dp/0876665776">"The Violin Hunter"</a> which I had read while waiting for my brothers lesson to end so we could do work on the violin. In the story, the main character walks into a saloon where violins are sold, in Paris. He is looking weatherworn and carries a sack. The proprietor asks the man if he can help him at which point the man begins to pull violins out of his sack and place them on the counter. The man then takes on of the violins and holds it up to the window so the light can hit it. This gesture is what I tried to capture with the hands holding the violin. That and an homage to the lady of the lake. I put on my tinkers cap and got to work making the top hand mechanized so that it grasps the neck of the fiddle when the case closes.</p>

                <p>Also added a foot to ensure that the case would not roll if opened like a regular violin case on its side.</p>

                <p>The case is as heavy as a log</p>

                <p>At the carving show in Belleville, IL, I won the peoples choice award, and third place in the miscellaneous category.</p>
